 AlphaByte 1.0 National Level Hackathon Project
A hiring platform project typically involves creating an online platform where employers can post job listings and candidates can search for and apply to these positions. The platform may include features such as profile creation for both employers and candidates, resume and portfolio uploads, job search filters, application tracking, messaging systems for communication between employers and candidates, and possibly even features like video interviews or skills assessments. The goal is to facilitate the hiring process for both employers and job seekers, making it more efficient and effective.
